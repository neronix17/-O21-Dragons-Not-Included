		<content>IMPORTANT: Vanilla Expanded Framework will be a requirement in future for coming content. Please make sure you have it enabled, or make a local copy of this version of the mod since it'll be the last one that doesn't need it.

Big content pack update, with two separate themes!
+ Sengoku
-- Added 14 Melee weapons
-- Added 6 Ranged/Thrown weapons

+ Highland
-- Added 5 Melee weapons
-- Added 1 Ranged weapons

Along with the additions there's fixes for previous stuff, just reworking apparel to account for the stuff it's made of for stats instead of having hard set stats. There's apparel that was due to be in this update, but I wasn't happy with the result so delayed them for the next update so the rest of this could be put out sooner.</content>
